          "answer": "MS-DOS was developed as an operating system that could run on any computer with an 8086-family microprocessor. It emulated the application programming interface (API) of CP/M, which was created by Gary Kildall. The creation of 86-DOS by Tim Paterson served as a foundation for MS-DOS, which later became widely used. 86-DOS was specifically designed to emulate the API of CP/M, indicating its direct influence from the earlier system.",

This was because each computer had distinct hardware that required a specific version of MS-DOS to operate efficiently. However, as 8086-family computers began emulating IBM hardware, the need for multiple versions of MS-DOS diminished, leading to a single, fixed version of MS-DOS being all that was needed for the market.",

With the advent of new analytical platforms such as mass spectrometry, chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance, it is now possible to identify and quantify most lipid metabolites from a single sample. This technique has been used to profile high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles in coronary bypass patients and healthy volunteers, finding significant differences in the lipid composition of HDL particles.
