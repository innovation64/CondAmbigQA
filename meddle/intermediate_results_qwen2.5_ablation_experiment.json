        "A casual match round lasts four minutes, while a ranked match round lasts three minutes. The one-minute preparation phase before each round adds some time to the overall match duration, but the core match length remains unchanged. Spectator mode provides additional perspectives but does not affect the match length. Time-limited seasonal events might extend match durations, although specific times are not clearly defined. Despite the addition of new maps and operators through DLC, the average round duration remains four minutes for casual and three minutes for ranked modes."

Due to the complexity of ensuring compatibility with the wide range of Android devices, the Android version was delayed until August 9, 2018. It first launched with a timed exclusivity for Samsung devices, lasting until August 12. On August 13, Epic began sending invites to users with non-Samsung devices, and by October 11, 2018, the Android version was available to all players without any restrictions. Initially, Epic chose to release Fortnite as a sideloaded app to avoid Google’s 30% revenue cut on microtransactions, but security concerns led to the discontinuation of the sideloaded version. By April 2020, Fortnite was made available on the Google Play store, ensuring broader access and addressing security risks."

Players can only be substituted during stoppages in play, such as throw-ins, goal kicks, or after fouls, and must have the referee's approval. The outgoing player must leave the field before the substitute can enter, and the substitute must enter from the halfway line. Once substituted, the player cannot return to the game. Substitutions are generally made for tactical adjustments or to replace tired, injured, or underperforming players. Non-compliance with substitution rules, such as entering too early, can lead to a yellow card.

        "The success of the Spanish conquest was aided by the Inca Civil War and the spread of diseases, which greatly weakened their society and military.  The Spanish military superiority and diseases like smallpox led to a rapid population decline, rendering the Inca unable to effectively resist the Spanish invasion. ",

The Spanish used advanced military technology, such as firearms and horses, and strategic tactics like capturing Emperor Atahualpa, to ultimately conquer the Inca Empire. ",
        "During the Spanish conquest, the Inca Empire faced multiple pressures, including disease, military strikes, and internal instability, which ultimately led to its collapse.  The Spanish conquest took about forty years, during which the Inca made several unsuccessful attempts to regain their empire. "
