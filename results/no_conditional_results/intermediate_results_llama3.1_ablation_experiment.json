In addition to this, the station is commonly referred to as KSR Bengaluru Station and Majestic Railway Station, especially in everyday communication by local residents. As the primary station in Bangalore, it is one of the busiest stations in the South Western Railway zone of Indian Railways and a crucial hub for handling major train routes, including KSR Bengaluru Mail, Rajdhani Express, and Lal Bagh Express. Over the years, the evolution and usage of these names reflect Bangalore’s modernization and cultural integration.",

These stations together form Bangalore's complex railway network, connecting the city center, suburbs, and other regions across the country."

        "The rood is initially adorned with gems, symbolizing its initial glory. However, during Jesus' crucifixion, it becomes stained with His blood, symbolizing its active role in the sacrifice. Both the Cross and Christ endure suffering together—pierced by nails, mocked, and tortured. The Cross is drenched in Jesus' blood, symbolizing the deep connection between Christ's suffering and the Cross. Ultimately, like Christ, the Cross is resurrected and adorned with gold and silver, becoming a powerful symbol of both suffering and redemption. The image of the blood-soaked Cross represents the unity of Christ's sacrifice and the instrument of salvation."

Due to the complexity of ensuring compatibility with the wide range of Android devices, the Android version was delayed until August 9, 2018. It first launched with a timed exclusivity for Samsung devices, lasting until August 12. On August 13, Epic began sending invites to users with non-Samsung devices, and by October 11, 2018, the Android version was available to all players without any restrictions. Initially, Epic chose to release Fortnite as a sideloaded app to avoid Google’s 30% revenue cut on microtransactions, but security concerns led to the discontinuation of the sideloaded version. By April 2020, Fortnite was made available on the Google Play store, ensuring broader access and addressing security risks."

        "Substitutions in soccer are governed by strict rules. Players can only be substituted during stoppages in play, such as throw-ins, goal kicks, or after fouls, and must have the referee's approval. The outgoing player must leave the field before the substitute can enter, and the substitute must enter from the halfway line. Once substituted, the player cannot return to the game. Substitutions are generally made for tactical adjustments or to replace tired, injured, or underperforming players. Non-compliance with substitution rules, such as entering too early, can lead to a yellow card. In variants like futsal and indoor soccer, substitutions are more flexible, with unlimited substitutions allowed, though goalkeepers often follow stricter substitution rules."
