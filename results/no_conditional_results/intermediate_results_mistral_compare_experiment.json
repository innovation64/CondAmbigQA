        "A casual match round lasts four minutes, while a ranked match round lasts three minutes. The one-minute preparation phase before each round adds some time to the overall match duration, but the core match length remains unchanged. Spectator mode provides additional perspectives but does not affect the match length. Time-limited seasonal events might extend match durations, although specific times are not clearly defined. Despite the addition of new maps and operators through DLC, the average round duration remains four minutes for casual and three minutes for ranked modes."

This process involves the formation of elements heavier than iron, including gold. However, these conditions are impossible to replicate on Earth and occur only on a cosmic scale. ",

While this experiment was conducted with bismuth rather than lead, it demonstrates the principle of manipulating atomic structures to create gold.

In terms of military involvement, the U.S. launched Operation Torch in North Africa on November 8, 1942. While this operation took place in Africa, it was a strategic part of the European theater, as it aimed to open a second front against Germany and pave the way for future operations in Europe."

Due to the complexity of ensuring compatibility with the wide range of Android devices, the Android version was delayed until August 9, 2018. It first launched with a timed exclusivity for Samsung devices, lasting until August 12. On August 13, Epic began sending invites to users with non-Samsung devices, and by October 11, 2018, the Android version was available to all players without any restrictions. Initially, Epic chose to release Fortnite as a sideloaded app to avoid Google’s 30% revenue cut on microtransactions, but security concerns led to the discontinuation of the sideloaded version. By April 2020, Fortnite was made available on the Google Play store, ensuring broader access and addressing security risks."

        "Substitutions in soccer are governed by strict rules. Players can only be substituted during stoppages in play, such as throw-ins, goal kicks, or after fouls, and must have the referee's approval. The outgoing player must leave the field before the substitute can enter, and the substitute must enter from the halfway line. Once substituted, the player cannot return to the game. Substitutions are generally made for tactical adjustments or to replace tired, injured, or underperforming players. Non-compliance with substitution rules, such as entering too early, can lead to a yellow card. In variants like futsal and indoor soccer, substitutions are more flexible, with unlimited substitutions allowed, though goalkeepers often follow stricter substitution rules."
