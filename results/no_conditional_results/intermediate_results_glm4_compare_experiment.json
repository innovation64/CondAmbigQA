Spectator mode provides additional perspectives but does not affect the match length. Time-limited seasonal events might extend match durations, although specific times are not clearly defined.

        "This process requires nuclear transmutation, achievable in particle accelerators or nuclear reactors. It involves manipulating protons and neutrons to alter lead's atomic structure. While theoretically possible, this method is currently prohibitively expensive, far exceeding gold's market value, making it impractical for real-world applications. ",
        "Such transformation could potentially occur through elemental transmutation in extreme cosmic conditions, such as supernovae. This process involves the formation of elements heavier than iron, including gold. However, these conditions are impossible to replicate on Earth and occur only on a cosmic scale. ",
        "Glenn Seaborg successfully transmuted several thousand bismuth atoms into gold by removing protons and neutrons. While this experiment was conducted with bismuth rather than lead, it demonstrates the principle of manipulating atomic structures to create gold. However, this technique remains far too expensive for routine gold production. "

Due to the complexity of ensuring compatibility with the wide range of Android devices, the Android version was delayed until August 9, 2018. It first launched with a timed exclusivity for Samsung devices, lasting until August 12. On August 13, Epic began sending invites to users with non-Samsung devices, and by October 11, 2018, the Android version was available to all players without any restrictions. Initially, Epic chose to release Fortnite as a sideloaded app to avoid Google’s 30% revenue cut on microtransactions, but security concerns led to the discontinuation of the sideloaded version. By April 2020, Fortnite was made available on the Google Play store, ensuring broader access and addressing security risks."

Players can only be substituted during stoppages in play, such as throw-ins, goal kicks, or after fouls, and must have the referee's approval. The outgoing player must leave the field before the substitute can enter, and the substitute must enter from the halfway line. Once substituted, the player cannot return to the game. Substitutions are generally made for tactical adjustments or to replace tired, injured, or underperforming players. Non-compliance with substitution rules, such as entering too early, can lead to a yellow card. In variants like futsal and indoor soccer, substitutions are more flexible, with unlimited substitutions allowed, though goalkeepers often follow stricter substitution rules."

The format brought much-needed convenience to audio recording, and by the mid-1970s, it became the mainstream medium for recording and playback. In the 1980s, Compact Cassettes gained widespread popularity due to the release of the Sony Walkman, making personal music listening portable and private. Compact Cassettes were used for pre-recorded music and home recordings until they were gradually replaced by CDs in the 1990s."
