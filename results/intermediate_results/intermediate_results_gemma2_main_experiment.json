          "answer": "Roman rule in Britain, lasting nearly four centuries until the early 5th century, had a profound impact on British society and language. While  Brittonic, the Celtic language spoken by the indigenous Britons, remained dominant,  the Romans introduced Latin which became the official language of administration and law. This led to the emergence of a hybrid language known as British Latin, evidenced in inscriptions and other archaeological finds.",
