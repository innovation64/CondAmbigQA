By the mid-1940s, antibiotics like streptomycin and para-aminosalicylic acid were introduced. In 1960, Sir John Crofton proposed the 'Edinburgh method,' combining three therapies for complete cure, which became the standard treatment for at least 15 years. Later improvements included the reduction of treatment duration using a combination of isoniazid and rifampin, followed by pyrazinamide in the 1980s.",

This is due to the axial tilt of the Earth, which causes the angle at which sunlight reaches the Earth to vary, leading to seasons. In regions like Troms, this variation results in extreme daylight differences between summer and winter.",

Furthermore, the state employed various methods such as poll taxes, literacy tests, and informal harassment to disenfranchise almost all African Americans and a large proportion of poor whites, effectively eliminating opposition parties outside of Winston County and nearby northern hill counties. This resulted in rural minorities dominating state politics for nearly three-quarters of the century.
