Although this book is fictional, the ideas behind oligarchical collectivism are closely tied to the real-world theory of bureaucratic collectivism. \nGeorge Orwell was inspired by James Burnham’s book *The Managerial Revolution* when constructing the totalitarian society in *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, using oligarchical collectivism as a satirical reflection of bureaucratic collectivism.",

This was later supplanted by Mikhail Bakunin's collectivist anarchism and finally to Peter Kropotkin's anarcho-communism. Social anarchists also adopted the strategy of syndicalism, using trade unions as a basis for a new socialist economy.",
